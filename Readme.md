# Java-projects

Hi Github!

In this repository I upload projects that I made with Java. 
All are simple projects that I wrote to exercise me with this programming language. 
Certainly you will find some errors but I will try to correct them and do less error in the future.
Make mistakes is the best way to learn new things :-)

Ps. I'm not a native speaker of english, sorry if I write stupid thinks or I make any mistakes with my english.
