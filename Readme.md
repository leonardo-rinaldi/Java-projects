# Java-projects

Hi Github!

In this repository i upload projects that i made with Java. 
All are simple projects that i wrote to exercise me with this programming language. 
Certainly you will find some errors but i will try to correct them and do less error in the future.
Make mistakes is the best way to learn new things :-)

Ps. I'm not a native speaker of english, sorry if i write stupid thinks or i make any mistakes with my english.
